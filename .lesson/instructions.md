# Instructions  

  ** exercises using if  **

_ Before you test your functions, choose 1 test case, calculate the expected results and put your test cases & results in comments (before the functions).  _ 

  ## Steps
  1. Ask the user for their grade, and tell them if they passed or not
  2. Ask the user for their age, and check if they are old enough to vote. If they are, display a message telling them so, otherwise tell them to try again in the appropriate number of years.  (Note: You can vote @ 18)
  3. Write a function called `calculate_tip` that takes a `tip_rate` and a `cost` as parameters. If the rate is greater than 1, divide it by 100 to get the percentage. Multiply the rate and the cost, and return the result
    1. ask the user for the rate and value
    3. call your function
    3. display the returned  tip value
  4. [your teacher may demonstrate this for you] Create a function `letter_grade` use it to implement and test the algorithm we had in the flowchart for letter grade that we saw during  the lecture.   (do not use `input()` nor `print()` inside your function)
    1.  what would be a good parameter to use ?
    2.  what should the function return ?
